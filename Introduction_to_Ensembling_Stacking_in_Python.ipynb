        "This notebook is a very basic and simple introductory primer to the method of ensembling (combining) base learning models, in particular the variant of ensembling known as Stacking. In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\n",
        "\n",
        "I myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\n",
        "\n",
        "Now onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner. My other standalone Kaggle script which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve"

However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions."
